Haveel must bond to a substrate of reliable quality, such as particle board, medium density fiber board, or plywood. For best result, follow the techniques recommended by the adhesive manufacturer.  The face and back laminated as well as substrate should be in conditioned in the environment for 48 hours before fabrication. <br />
The recommended conditioning temperature is 75 F (24 C) and relative humidity is about 45%. To avoid stress cracking, do not use square-cut corners. All inside corners should have a minimum of 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) radius and edges should be routed smooth.
